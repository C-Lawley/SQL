# Candace's SQL Portfolio

## Welcome to My SQL Portfolio!

This repository is a curated collection of projects that reflect my ongoing journey in mastering SQL. Each project showcases my growing expertise in database management, data analysis, and query optimization, with each new addition building on the skills Iâ€™ve developed. I encourage you to explore my work and reach out if you have any questions.
